BITCOIN BUDGET

The Bitcoin Budget app is an app that allows you to calculate the amount of Bitcoin you will have if you make a recurring purchase over a certain period of time. Besides telling you the amount of Bitcoin you will have, it also tells you the value of your Bitcoin in USD, either at the current Bitcoin Price as per the CoinMarketCap API or at a target BTC price that you can set yourself.
